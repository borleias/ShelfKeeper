feat(billing): Implement background tasks and email notifications for subscriptions

This commit completes the billing module by adding background tasks for subscription management and an email notification system.

- **Implemented `IEmailService` and `DummyEmailService`** for sending email notifications.
- **Implemented `SubscriptionDowngradeChecker`** as a background service to monitor media item limits after subscription downgrades.
- **Made `SubscriptionDowngradeChecker` interval configurable** via `appsettings.json`.
- **Updated `Program.cs`** to register the email service and the background checker.
