feat: Implement core features and refactor architecture

This commit introduces the following major changes:

- **Project Structure:** Established a Clean Architecture pattern with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and WebApi layers.
- **Entity Definitions:** Defined core entities (User, MediaItem, Author, Location, Tag, Subscription, Image) in the Domain layer.
- **Database Setup:** Configured PostgreSQL with Docker Compose, including schema and extensive seed data for all entities.
- **User Management:** Implemented user registration, login (with JWT authentication), password reset, and account deletion.
- **Media Item Management:** Implemented CRUD operations for media items, including listing with search, filter, and dynamic sorting.
- **Barcode Scanning:** Added a placeholder service for barcode scanning integration.
- **Security:** Integrated JWT authentication and BCrypt password hashing.
- **Observability:** Configured Serilog for logging and OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics (Prometheus exporter).
- **API Versioning:** Implemented API versioning for future extensibility.
- **Code Quality:** Removed MediatR, replaced `var` with explicit types, and added comprehensive XML documentation to all methods and file headers.
- **Docker Integration:** Ensured the Web API is runnable within Docker Compose.

This commit addresses the initial MVP requirements and sets a solid foundation for future development.
