feat: Add Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

This commit integrates Prometheus and Grafana into the Docker Compose setup for application monitoring.

- Added `docker/prometheus` and `docker/grafana` directories.
- Created `prometheus.yml` for basic scraping configuration.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include Prometheus and Grafana services.
- Added `docker/grafana/` to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking Grafana data.
